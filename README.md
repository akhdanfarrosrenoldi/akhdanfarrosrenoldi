# 👨‍💻 Akhdan Farros Renoldi

Hi there! I’m Akhdan — an Informatics graduate passionate about web development, data analysis, and smart solutions. With hands-on experience building dynamic websites using Laravel and CodeIgniter, I also enjoy exploring the potential of data through machine learning, particularly using Python and NLP models like IndoBERT.

Currently, I’m focusing on expanding my full-stack development skills while exploring how data-driven systems can help solve real business problems. I thrive on continuous learning and enjoy working on projects that blend creativity, logic, and real-world impact.
